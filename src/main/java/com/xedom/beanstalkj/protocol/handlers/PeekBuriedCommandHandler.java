/**
 * <pre>
 * The peek commands let the client inspect a job in the system. There are four
 * variations. All but the first operate only on the currently used tube.
 * 
 *   - &quot;peek-buried\r\n&quot; - return the next job in the list of buried jobs.
 *  
 *  There are two possible responses, either a single line:
 * 
 *  - &quot;NOT_FOUND\r\n&quot; if the requested job doesn't exist or there are no jobs in
 *    the requested state.
 * 
 * Or a line followed by a chunk of data, if the command was successful:
 * 
 * FOUND &lt;id&gt; &lt;bytes&gt;\r\n
 * &lt;data&gt;\r\n
 * 
 *  - &lt;id&gt; is the job id.
 * 
 *  - &lt;bytes&gt; is an integer indicating the size of the job body, not including
 *    the trailing &quot;\r\n&quot;.
 * 
 *  - &lt;data&gt; is the job body -- a sequence of bytes of length &lt;bytes&gt; from the
 *    previous line.
 *
